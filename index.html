    <h2>About us</h2>
    <p>Rescue. Rehabilitate. Rehome.</p>
    <p>At Pawdopt, we believe every dog deserves a second chance — and a forever home.
We’re a passionate team of dog lovers, rescuers, and volunteers dedicated to helping abandoned, neglected, and homeless dogs find loving families. Whether they come from shelters, the streets, or tough situations, we’re here to give them a fresh start.

We focus on ethical adoption, responsible pet ownership, and matching each dog with the right person or family.
We work closely with local shelters and foster homes to provide dogs with the care, training, and love they need until they’re ready for adoption.

Whether you’re ready to adopt, foster, donate, or simply spread the word — thank you for being part of the journey.</p>
